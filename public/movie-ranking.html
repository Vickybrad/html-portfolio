<h1> The Best Kdrama Series According To Victoria</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Kdrama of All Times</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3> Weak Hero Class 1</h3>
<p>This movie is just so awesome, and the acting is so realistic and on point</p> 
<h3> It's Okay Not To Be Okay</h3>
<p>Being older you'd get to really relate to the kSeries alot and understand that despite your responsibilities and burden it is okay to be vulnerable in love.</p>
<p>It also throws more light on how muc family tramua's affects how you see, feel and reacts to things and even people<br> It's just a beautiful story. </p>
<h3> Mr Queen</h3>
<p>Looking for a movie to make you laugh, then then this is for you. Choi is an amazing actress making it one of my top three. </p>
